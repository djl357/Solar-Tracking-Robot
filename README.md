# Solar-Tracking-Robot

This system is a solar tracker that performs a sweep of 180 degrees and measures the sunlight at set intervals. After completing the sweep, the data is analyzed and the servo is pulsed until the system faces the direction of greatest light intensity. A solar panel can be easily mounted onto the system, allowing the panel to always point in the optimal direction and operate at maximum efficiency.
